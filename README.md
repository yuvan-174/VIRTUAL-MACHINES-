# EX 6: MOVING FILES BETWEEN VIRTUAL MACHINES
## Name : YUVAN SUNDAR S
## Reg No : 212223040250
## Aim:
To move the files between virtual machine.


 You can move files between virtual machines in several ways:

•	You can copy files using network utilities as you would between physical computers on your network. To do this between two virtual machine:

•	Both virtual machines must be configured to allow access to your network.

•	Any of the networking methods (host-only, bridged and NAT) are appropriate. 

•	With host-only networking, you copy files from the virtual machines to the host and vice-versa, since host-only networking only allows the virtual machines see your host computer.

•	With bridged networking or NAT enabled, you can copy files across your network between the virtual machines.

•	You can create a shared drive, either a virtual disk or a raw partition, and mount the drive in each of the virtual machines.
## Procedure:
How to Enable File sharing in VirtualBox. 

Step 1. Install Guest Additions on the Guest machine. 

Step 2. Configure File Sharing on VirtualBox. 
 
## Step 1. Install Guest Additions on the Guest machine. 
1. Start the Virtuabox Guest Machine (OS). 

2. From Oracle's VM VirtualBox main menu, select Devices > Install Guest Additions *

a. Open Windows Explorer

b. Double click at the "CD Drive (X:) VirtualBox Guest additions" to explore its contents.

4. When the setup is completed, choose Finish and restart the Virtuabox guest machine.

## Step 2. Setup File Sharing on VirtualBox Guest Machine.
1. From VirtualBox menu click Devices and choose Shared Folders -> Shared Folder Settings.

3. Locate and highlight (from the Host OS) the folder that you want to share between the VirtualBox Guest machine and the Host and click Select Folder. *
* Note: To make your life easier, create a new folder for the file sharing, on the Host OS and give it with a recognizable name. (e.g. "Public")

5. You 're done! To access the shared folder from the Guest OS, open Windows Explorer and under the 'Network locations' you should see a new network drive that corresponds to the shared folder on the Host OS.

## Result:

Thus the virtual machine files are moved to another VM
